# Vision & Principles

## What is $ART?

The Tokenized Art Project ($ART) is a transparent, artist-first platform for tokenizing artwork and establishing verifiable ownership on the blockchain.

Art has been one of humanity's most valuable assets for centuries. However, traditional art markets lack transparency, accessibility, and clear provenance tracking. $ART introduces a new paradigm where:

- **Artists** retain control and earn royalties forever
- **Collectors** have verifiable, immutable proof of ownership
- **Provenance** is transparent and permanently recorded
- **Culture** is preserved for future generations

## Core Principles

### 1. Artist-First Design

Every decision prioritizes the needs of artists:
- Artists control their artwork metadata
- Configurable royalties on all secondary sales
- No platform lock-in or hidden fees
- Direct artist-collector relationships

### 2. Provenance & Authenticity

All artwork provenance is immutably recorded:
- Original artist attribution
- Complete ownership history
- Sale prices and dates
- Artwork authenticity verification

### 3. On-Chain Ownership

True ownership lives on the blockchain:
- ERC-721 for unique 1/1 artworks
- ERC-1155 for limited editions
- No centralized gatekeepers
- Ownership persists forever

### 4. Minimal Intermediaries

Direct connections between artists and collectors:
- Simple, transparent marketplace
- Low platform fees (2.5%)
- No aggressive trading mechanisms
- Focus on art, not speculation

### 5. Long-Term Preservation

Art is meant to last:
- Artwork stored on IPFS/Arweave
- On-chain hash verification
- Immutable metadata
- Cultural value over financial speculation

## Not a Financial Product

**$ART is not an investment vehicle.** It is cultural infrastructure.

The optional $ART governance token exists solely for:
- Platform governance decisions
- Community participation
- Signaling and curation

There is **no promise of profit**. The value is in the art itself and the cultural ecosystem we're building.
