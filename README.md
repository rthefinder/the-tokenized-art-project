# The Tokenized Art Project ($ART)

Art has been one of humanity’s most valuable assets for centuries.

The Tokenized Art Project ($ART) introduces a new way for artists to tokenize their work and for collectors to prove ownership directly on-chain.

By leveraging blockchain technology, $ART aims to create a transparent, verifiable, and artist-first ecosystem where digital and physical artworks can be owned, traded, and preserved without intermediaries.
